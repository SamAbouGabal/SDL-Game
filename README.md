# SDL Game (Still in development) 

It's the start of a small top down RPG where you play as a knight traversingthrought the world.
Future adds are:
-Implement the enemy and it's animations
  - That Enemy can inflict dammage to player
  - Add a boss
-Other NPC's that the player can interact with
    -Shop keeper
    -Quest giver 
-Further extend the map (have an idea of creating a collider on the borders of the screen that loads in a new tile map)
  -Add a minimap in that case (maybe with a diablo esque feel to it)
-Add a loot pool
-Create more textures and sprites
